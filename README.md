## What is FlatImage?

FlatImage, is a hybrid of [Flatpak](https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak)
sandboxing with [AppImage](https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit) portability.

FlatImage use case is twofold:

* A tool to package software that aims to work across several linux distros,
it bundles all the software dependencies and the software itself, within an
executable; unlike `AppImage`, FlatImage runs the application in a container, which
increases portability and compatibility at the cost of file size.

* A portable container image that requires no superuser permissions to run.

The diverse `GNU/Linux` ecosystem includes a vast array of distributions, each
with its own advantages and use cases. This can lead to cross-distribution
software compatibility challenges. FlatImage addresses these issues by:

* Utilizing its own root directory, enabling dynamic libraries with hard-coded
    paths to be packaged alongside the software without
    [binary patching](https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit/wiki/Bundling-Windows-applications).
* Running the application in its own gnu system, therefore, not using host
    libraries that might be outdated/incompatible with the application.

# Get FlatImage

You can get the latest release [here](https://github.com/ruanformigoni/flatimage/releases), and extract the compressed archive with your file manager or with `tar -xf some-file.tar.xz`. To verify the image integrity, you can use the `sha256sum` file that accompanies each release, like so: `sha256sum -c some-file.flatimage.sha256sum`.

# Usage

You can enter the container simply by executing the downloaded image, e.g.,
`./arch.flatimage`, which should give you a prompt like this `(flatimage@arch) â†’`.
Remember to resize the image as shown in the examples before installing programs
on it, else there won't be enough space for it.

To enter the container as root (to install software) use:
```
./arch.flatimage fim-root bash
```

## Options

```
Avaliable options:
- fim-compress: Compress the filesystem to a read-only format.
- fim-root: Execute an arbitrary command as root.
- fim-exec: Execute an arbitrary command.
- fim-cmd: Set the default command to execute when no argument is passed.
- fim-resize: Resizes the filesystem.
    - # Resizes the filesytem to have 1G of size
    - E.g.: ./arch.flatimage fim-resize 1G
    - # Resizes the filesystem by current size plus 1G
    - E.g.: ./arch.flatimage fim-resize +1G
- fim-mount: Mount the filesystem in a specified directory
    - E.g.: ./arch.flatimage fim-mount ./mountpoint
- fim-xdg: Same as the 'fim-mount' command, however it opens the
    mount directory with xdg-open
- fim-perms-set: Set the permission for the container, available options are:
    pulseaudio, wayland, x11, session_bus, system_bus, gpu, input, usb
    - E.g.: ./arch.flatimage fim-perms pulseaudio,wayland,x11
- fim-perms-list: List the current permissions for the container
- fim-config-set: Sets a configuration that persists inside the image
    - E.g.: ./arch.flatimage fim-config-set home '"$FIM_FILE_BINARY".home
    - E.g.: ./arch.flatimage fim-config-set backend "proot"
- fim-config-list: List the current configurations for the container
    - E.g.: ./arch.flatimage fim-config-list                      # List all
    - E.g.: ./arch.flatimage fim-config-list "^dwarfs.*"          # List ones that match regex
- fim-dwarfs-add: Includes a dwarfs file inside the image, it is
                      automatically mounted on startup to the specified mount point
    - E.g.: ./arch.flatimage fim-dwarfs-add ./image.dwarfs /opt/image

    automatically grows it gets past it in the previous execution, default is
    50000000 bytes (50MB).
* `FIM_COMPRESSION_DIRS`: Directories to compress with dwarfs, default is `/usr /opt`.
* `FIM_DEBUG`: If defined to 1, print debug messages.
* `FIM_FIFO`: If defined to 1, use FIFO when stdout/stderr are not connected to a terminal, default is 1.

The default path of `FIM` temporary files is `/tmp/fim`.

## Configure

### HOME directory

It is possible to change the default home path with `fim-config-set home`,
e.g.:

```bash
 # Default, uses the host's home directory
$ ./arch.flatimage fim-config-set home '$HOME'
 # The name of the flatimage binary plus an appended ".home"
$ ./arch.flatimage fim-config-set home '"$FIM_FILE_BINARY".home'
```

### Backend

Besides the environment variable `FIM_BACKEND`, it is possible to use the
`fim-config-set backend` to set the default tool. The environment variable
always takes precedence if defined.

```bash
 # Uses bwrap as the backend (default)
$ ./arch.flatimage fim-config-set backend "bwrap"
 # Uses proot as the backend
$ ./arch.flatimage fim-config-set backend "proot"
 # Run command on host using a static bash binary
$ ./arch.flatimage fim-config-set backend "host"
```

### Desktop Integration

#### Desktop Entry and File Manager Icon

Flatimage supports desktop integration, the icon and menu entry should appear
after the first execution. Make sure to have this line in your `~/.bashrc`
file:

```bash
export XDG_DATA_DIRS=$HOME/.local/share:$XDG_DATA_DIRS
```

After including it, log out and log in again (or reboot) for the changes apply.
Here's how to configure flatimage desktop integration:

```bash
 # Set the name of your application
$ ./arch.flatimage fim-config-set name "MyApp"
 # Set the icon, supported image types are '.svg,.png,.jpg'
$ ./arch.flatimage fim-config-set icon '"$FIM_DIR_MOUNT"/fim/desktop/icon.png'
 # Copy icon to inside the container
$ ./arch.flatimage fim-root cp ./my-image.png /fim/desktop/icon.png
 # Set the categories of your application
 # Avaliable categories found here: https://specifications.freedesktop.org/menu-spec/latest/apa.html
$ ./arch.flatimage fim-config-set categories "Game"
 # Enable desktop integration
$ ./arch.flatimage fim-config-set desktop 1
```

You can also disable desktop integration with:

```bash
 # Disable desktop integration
$ ./arch.flatimage fim-config-set desktop 0
```

To erase all desktop entries and icons created by flatimage, you can use the
command:

```bash
$ find ~/.local/share -iname "*flatimage*" -exec rm -v "{}" \;
```

#### XDG-Open

Flatimage redirects `xdg-open` commands to the host machine

Examples:

* Open a video file with the host default video player: `xdg-open my-file.mkv`
* Open a link with the host default browser: `xdg-open www.google.com`

### Overlayfs

Overlayfs is automatically enabled for all compressed filesystems.

### Hooks

You can include `bash` hooks to execute code before and/or after your program:

```bash
 # Include hook
$ ./arch.flatimage fim-hook-add-pre ./my-pre-hook
```

This is an example of a pre-hook file:
```bash
export MY_VAR="hello there, I'm defined inside flatimage!"

echo "Starting my cool program"

if [[ -v MY_OPTION ]]; then
  echo "You passed the option: ${MY_OPTION}!" 
fi
```

To remove the hook, just use:
```bash
./arch.flatimage fim-exec rm /fim/hooks/pre/my-pre-hook
```
... or enter the container, `cd /fim/hooks/pre` and erase the files.

To insert a post hook, just use the directory `post` instead.
```bash
 # Include hook
$ ./arch.flatimage fim-hook-add-post ./my-post-hook
```

## Portals

Flatimage has a portal mechanism to dispatch commands to the host machine.

Examples:
* Open thunar in the host machine: `fim_portal_guest thunar`
* Open thunar in the host machine (full path): `fim_portal_guest /bin/thunar`
* Open the desktop folder with thunar on the host machine: `fim_portal_guest thunar ~/Desktop`

# Use cases

To use FlatImage there is no need to install anything, simply download an image in
the [releases](https://github.com/ruanformigoni/flatimage/releases) page, i.e., `focal
(ubuntu)`, `alpine` or `arch`. The archive is compressed, extract it and use it
as shown in the following examples.

$ ./arch.flatimage fim-perms-set wayland,pulseaudio,gpu,session_bus
 # Install the desired application in the ubuntu subsystem
$ ./arch.flatimage fim-root fakechroot pacman -S firefox --noconfirm
 # Test the application
$ ./arch.flatimage fim-exec firefox
 # Set the default startup command
$ ./arch.flatimage fim-cmd firefox
 # (optional) Compress the package filesystem

### Outside the container

```sh
 # Set the maximum filesystem size (use du -sh ./arch.flatimage to see actual size)
$ ./arch.flatimage fim-resize 4G
 # Fetch the application
$ git clone https://github.com/htop-dev/htop.git
 # Install the required build dependencies
$ ./arch.flatimage fim-root fakechroot pacman -S ncurses automake autoconf gcc make
 # Compile the application
cd htop
$ ../arch.flatimage fim-exec './autogen.sh'
$ ../arch.flatimage fim-exec './configure'
$ ../arch.flatimage fim-exec 'make'
 # Run the compiled application
$ ./htop
```

### Inside the container

```bash
 # Set the maximum filesystem size (use du -sh ./arch.flatimage to see actual size)
$ ./arch.flatimage fim-resize 4G
 # Fetch the application
$ git clone https://github.com/htop-dev/htop.git
 # Enter the container as root
$ FIM_ROOT=1 ./arch.flatimage
 # Install the required build dependencies
 (fim@arch) â†’ fakechroot pacman -S ncurses automake autoconf gcc make
 # Compile
 (fim@arch) â†’ cd htop
 (fim@arch) â†’ ./autogen.sh
 (fim@arch) â†’ ./configure
 (fim@arch) â†’ make
 # Run
 (fim@arch) â†’ ./htop
```

In this case `arch.flatimage` is now a portable building environment for htop.

# Samples

## Portable steam

Creates a portable steam installation that works on both `GNU` and `MUSL` systems:

```
wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ruanformigoni/flatimage/master/samples/steam.sh | sh
```

The home directory (where your games will be installed into) for this steam sample is always on the same directory as the flatimage, in a folder called `steam.home`. This enables the usage of steam on an external hard drive that maybe plugged in several linux distros, without having to re-configure anything.

## Portable wine

Creates a portable wine installation that works on both `GNU` and `MUSL` systems:

```
wget https://github.com/gameimage/runners/releases/download/wine-gnu-x86_64/base.flatimage.tar.xz
wget https://github.com/gameimage/runners/releases/download/wine-gnu-x86_64/staging.dwarfs
tar xf base.flatimage.tar.xz
rm base.flatimage.tar.xz
chmod +x base.flatimage
./base.flatimage fim-dwarfs-add staging.dwarfs /fim/mount/wine
rm staging.dwarfs
mv ./base.flatimage ./wine
```

You can use it simply by:

# Usage Inside Docker

Currently to run a flatimage inside docker, the `--privileged` flag is required.
Assuming that the current directory contains the image `alpine.flatimage`:

```
docker run --privileged -it --rm -v "$(pwd):/workdir" ubuntu:focal /bin/bash
cd workdir
./alpine.flatimage
```

# Architecture

Example of flatimage's arrangement for compressed filesystems with overlayfs,
bubblewrap binds and symlinks.

# Further Considerations

FlatImage offers on build simplicity, packaging applications should be as simple as
installing them natively on the host system. This is an effort for the end-user
to not depend on the application developer to provide the portable binary (or to
handle how to package the application, dependencies and create a runner script).
It also simplifies the quality of life of the package developer, simplifying
the packaging process of applications.

# Motivations

1. The idea of this application sprung with the challenge to package software
   and dynamic libraries, such as `wine`, when there are hard-coded paths. The
   best solution is invasive
   [https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit/wiki/Bundling-Windows-applications](https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit/wiki/Bundling-Windows-applications)
   , which patches the binaries of wine directly to use a custom path for the
   32-bit libraries (an implementation of this concept is available
   [here](https://github.com/ruanformigoni/wine)), not only that, it requires to
   patch the `32-bit` pre-loader `ld-linux.so` as well, however, sometimes it
   still fails to execute properly. This is an over exceeding complexity for the
   end-user, which should package applications with no effort; `FlatImage`
   changes the root filesystem the application runs in, to a minimal gnu
   subsystem, and with that, it solves the previous issues with dynamic
   libraries no workarounds required. No host libraries are used, which
   decreases issues of portable applications working on one machine and not in
   other.

1. The fragmentation of the linux package management is considerable in modern
   times, e.g., `apt`, `pip`, `npm`, and more. To mitigate this issue
   `FlatImage` can perform the installation through the preferred package
   manager, and turn the program into an executable file, that can run in any
   linux distribution. E.g.: The user of `FlatImage` can create a binary of
   `youtube-dl`, from the `pip` package manager, without having either pip or
   python installed on the host operating system.

1. Some applications are offered as pre-compiled compressed tar files
   (tarballs), which sometimes only work when installed on the root of the
   operating system. However, doing so could hinder the operating system
   integrity, to avoid this issue `FlatImage` can install tarballs into itself
   and turn them into a portable binary.
