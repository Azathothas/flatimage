## What is FlatImage?

FlatImage, is a hybrid of [Flatpak](https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak)
sandboxing with [AppImage](https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit) portability.

FlatImage use case is twofold:

* A tool to package software that aims to work across several linux distros,
it bundles all the software dependencies and the software itself, within an
executable; unlike `AppImage`, FlatImage runs the application in a container, which
increases portability and compatibility at the cost of file size.

* A portable container image that requires no superuser permissions to run.

The diverse `GNU/Linux` ecosystem includes a vast array of distributions, each
with its own advantages and use cases. This can lead to cross-distribution
software compatibility challenges. FlatImage addresses these issues by:

* Utilizing its own root directory, enabling dynamic libraries with hard-coded
    paths to be packaged alongside the software without
    [binary patching](https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit/wiki/Bundling-Windows-applications).
* Running the application in its own gnu system, therefore, not using host
    libraries that might be outdated/incompatible with the application.

# Get FlatImage

You can get the latest release [here](https://gitlab.com/formigoni/flatimage/-/releases).

# Usage

You can enter the container simply by executing the downloaded image, e.g.,
`./arch.fim`, which should give you a prompt like this `(flatimage@arch) â†’`.
Remember to resize the image as shown in the examples before installing programs
on it, else there won't be enough space for it.

## Options

```
 # FlatImage
Avaliable options:
- fim-compress: Compress the filesystem to a read-only format.
- fim-root: Execute an arbitrary command as root.
- fim-exec: Execute an arbitrary command.
- fim-cmd: Set the default command to execute when no argument is passed.
- fim-resize: Resizes the filesystem.
    - # Resizes the filesytem to have 1G of size
    - E.g.: ./focal.fim fim-resize 1G
    - # Resizes the filesystem by current size plus 1G
    - E.g.: ./focal.fim fim-resize +1G
- fim-mount: Mount the filesystem in a specified directory
    - E.g.: ./focal.fim fim-mount ./mountpoint
- fim-xdg: Same as the 'fim-mount' command, however it opens the
    mount directory with xdg-open
- fim-perms-set: Set the permission for the container, available options are:
    pulseaudio, wayland, x11, session_bus, system_bus, gpu, input, usb
    - E.g.: ./focal.fim fim-perms pulseaudio,wayland,x11
- fim-perms-list: List the current permissions for the container
- fim-config-set: Sets a configuration that persists inside the image
    - E.g.: ./focal.fim fim-config-set home '"\$FIM_DIR_BINARY"/home.focal'
    - E.g.: ./focal.fim fim-config-set backend "proot"
- fim-config-list: List the current configurations for the container
    - E.g.: ./focal.fim fim-config-list                      # List all
    - E.g.: ./focal.fim fim-config-list "overlay.*"          # List ones that match regex
    - E.g.: ./focal.fim fim-config-list --single "overlay.*" # Stop on first match
    - E.g.: ./focal.fim fim-config-list --value  "overlay.*" # Print only the value
- fim-include-path: Includes a path inside the image, automatically resizing it in the process
    - E.g.: ./focal.fim fim-include-path ../my-dir /opt/new-folder1/new-folder2
    - E.g.: ./focal.fim fim-include-path ../my-file.tar /fim/tarballs
- fim-help: Print this message.
```

## Environment Variables

### Configurable

* `FIM_NAME`: Name of the package, useful for desktop integration (default is flatimage-$FIM_DIST)
* `FIM_ICON`: Path to the application icon, default is '"$FIM_DIR_MOUNT"/fim/desktop/icon.svg'
* `FIM_BACKEND`: Back-end to use, default is `bwrap`, `proot` is also supported.
* `FIM_COMPRESSION_LEVEL`: Compression level of dwarfs (0-9), default is 6
* `FIM_SLACK_MINIMUM`: Free space always available on the filesystem startup,
    automatically grows it gets past it in the previous execution, default is
    50000000 bytes (50MB).
* `FIM_COMPRESSION_DIRS`: Directories to compress with dwarfs, default is `/usr /opt`.
* `FIM_DEBUG`: If defined to 1, print debug messages.

### Read-Only

* `FIM_DIST`: The linux distribution name (alpine, arch, ubuntu)
* `FIM_PATH_FILE_BINARY`: Full path to the executed binary file
* `FIM_FILE_BINARY`: Basename of the executed binary file.
* `FIM_DIR_BINARY`: The path to the directory of the executed binary file.
* `FIM_DIR_TEMP`: Location of the temporary runtime directory.
* `FIM_DIR_MOUNT`: Location of the runtime fim mountpoint.
* `FIM_MAIN_OFFSET`: Shows filesystem offset and exits.


The default path of `FIM` temporary files is `/tmp/fim`.

## Configure

### HOME directory

It is possible to change the default home path with `fim-config-set home`,
e.g.:

```bash
 # Default, uses the host's home directory
./arch.fim fim-config-set home '$HOME'
 # Use the directory where the fim binary is located / arch.home, if called from
 # $HOME/Downloads, the home directory would be $HOME/Downloads/arch.home.
./arch.fim fim-config-set home '"$FIM_DIR_BINARY"/arch.home'
 # You can use subshells to compute the path, in this case it computes the
 # directory where the fim binary is in, same as "$FIM_DIR_BINARY"
./arch.fim fim-config-set home '"$(dirname "$FIM_FILE_BINARY")"/arch.home'
```

### Backend

Besides the environment variable `FIM_BACKEND`, it is possible to use the
`fim-config-set backend` to set the default tool. The environment variable
always takes precedence if defined.

```bash
 # Uses bwrap as the backend (default)
./arch.fim fim-config-set backend "bwrap"
 # Uses proot as the backend
./arch.fim fim-config-set backend "proot"
 # Run command on host using a static bash binary
./arch.fim fim-config-set backend "host"
```

### Desktop Integration

Flatimage supports desktop integration, the icon and menu entry should appear
after the first execution. Make sure to have this line in your `~/.bashrc`
file:

```bash
export XDG_DATA_DIRS=$HOME/.local/share/applications/:$XDG_DATA_DIRS
```

After including it, log out and log in again (or reboot) for the changes apply.
Here's how to configure flatimage desktop integration:

```bash
 # Set the name of your application
./arch.fim fim-config-set name "MyApp"
 # Set the icon, supported image types are '.svg,.png,.jpg'
./arch.fim fim-config-set icon '"$FIM_DIR_MOUNT"/fim/desktop/icon.png'
 # Copy icon to inside the container
./arch.fim fim-root cp ./my-image.png /fim/desktop/icon.png
 # Set the categories of your application
 # Avaliable categories found here: https://specifications.freedesktop.org/menu-spec/latest/apa.html
 ./arch.fim fim-config-set categories "Game"
 # Enable desktop integration
./arch.fim fim-config-set desktop 1
```

You can also disable desktop integration with:

```bash
 # Disable desktop integration
./arch.fim fim-config-set desktop 0
```

To erase all desktop entries and icons created by flatimage, you can use the
command:

```bash
find ~/.local/share -iname "*flatimage*" -exec rm -v "{}" \;
```

### Overlayfs

You can use overlayfs on top of the `dwarfs` filesystems, e.g.:

```bash
 # Compress
./arch.fim fim-compress
 # Configure overlayfs paths
./arch.fim fim-config-set overlay.usr "My /usr overlay"
./arch.fim fim-config-set overlay.usr.host '"$FIM_PATH_FILE_BINARY".overlay'
./arch.fim fim-config-set overlay.usr.cont '/usr'
 # Verify
./arch.fim
(flatimage@arch) â†’ ls -l / | grep "usr ->"
```

# Use cases

To use FlatImage there is no need to install anything, simply download an image in
the [releases](https://gitlab.com/formigoni/art/-/releases) page, i.e., `focal
(ubuntu)`, `alpine` or `arch`. The archive is compressed, extract it and use it
as shown in the following examples.

mv focal.fim yt-dlp.fim
 # Use the application (download youtube video)
./yt-dlp.fim -f 'bestvideo+bestaudio' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srnyVw-OR0g
```

## Use an npm package without installing npm

### Outside the container

__Archlinux__

```sh
 # Set the maximum filesystem size (use du -sh ./focal.fim to see actual size)
./arch.fim fim-resize 4G
 # Set the desired permissions (so vlc can play from inside the container)
./arch.fim fim-perms-set x11,pulseaudio
 # Install npm/nodejs into the image
 ./arch.fim fim-root fakechroot pacman -S nodejs npm vlc
 # Configure prefix to the root of the image
 ./arch.fim fim-exec npm config set prefix -g '/usr/local/'
 # Install the npm application inside the image
 ./arch.fim fim-root fakechroot npm install -g webtorrent-cli
 # Test the application
./arch.fim fim-exec webtorrent "magnet:?xt=urn:btih:dd8255ecdc7ca55fb0bbf81323d87062db1f6d1c" --vlc
 # Set the default startup command
./arch.fim fim-cmd webtorrent
 # (optional) Compress the package filesystem
./arch.fim fim-compress
 # (optional) Rename the binary to the main application name
mv arch.fim webtorrent
 # Use the application (stream legal torrent video)
./webtorrent "magnet:?xt=urn:btih:dd8255ecdc7ca55fb0bbf81323d87062db1f6d1c" --vlc
```

__Ubuntu__

```sh
 # Set the maximum filesystem size (use du -sh ./focal.fim to see actual size)
./focal.fim fim-resize 4G
 # Set the desired permissions (so vlc can play from inside the container)
./focal.fim fim-perms-set x11,pulseaudio
 # Install npm/nodejs into the image
./focal.fim fim-root apt install -y curl
./focal.fim fim-root curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_19.x | bash -
./focal.fim fim-root apt-get install -y nodejs mpv
 # Configure prefix to the root of the image
./focal.fim fim-root npm config set prefix -g /usr/local
 # Install the npm application inside the image
./focal.fim fim-root npm install -g webtorrent-cli
 # Test the application
./focal.fim fim-exec webtorrent magnet:?xt=urn:btih:dd8255ecdc7ca55fb0bbf81323d87062db1f6d1c --mpv
 # Set the default startup command
./focal.fim fim-cmd webtorrent
 # (optional) Compress the package filesystem
./focal.fim fim-compress
 # (optional) Rename the binary to the main application name
mv focal.fim webtorrent.fim
 # Use the application (stream legal torrent video)
./webtorrent.fim magnet:?xt=urn:btih:dd8255ecdc7ca55fb0bbf81323d87062db1f6d1c --mpv
```

Note that vlc/mpv was installed inside the image, it is required since the image
has no access to the host filesystem/applications.

### Inside the container

```sh
 # Set the maximum filesystem size (use du -sh ./focal.fim to see actual size)
./arch.fim fim-resize 4G
 # Set the desired permissions (so vlc can play from inside the container)
./arch.fim fim-perms-set x11,pulseaudio
 # Enter the container as root
FIM_ROOT=1 ./arch.fim
 # Install npm/nodejs into the image
(fim@arch) â†’ fakechroot pacman -S nodejs npm vlc
 # Configure prefix to the root of the image
(fim@arch) â†’ npm config set prefix -g '/usr/local/'
 # Install the npm application inside the image
(fim@arch) â†’ fakechroot npm install -g webtorrent-cli
 # Press CTRL+D or type exit to quit the container
 # Enter the container as an unprivileged user
./arch.fim
 # Test the application
(fim@arch) â†’ webtorrent "magnet:?xt=urn:btih:dd8255ecdc7ca55fb0bbf81323d87062db1f6d1c" --vlc
 # Press CTRL+D or type exit to quit the container
 # Set the default startup command
./arch.fim fim-cmd webtorrent
 # (optional) Compress the package filesystem
./arch.fim fim-compress
 # (optional) Rename the binary to the main application name
mv arch.fim webtorrent
 # Use the application (stream legal torrent video)
./webtorrent "magnet:?xt=urn:btih:dd8255ecdc7ca55fb0bbf81323d87062db1f6d1c" --vlc
```

## Compile an application without installing dependencies on the host

### Outside the container

```sh
 # Set the maximum filesystem size (use du -sh ./focal.fim to see actual size)
./arch.fim fim-resize 4G
 # Fetch the application
git clone https://github.com/htop-dev/htop.git
 # Install the required build dependencies
./arch.fim fim-root fakechroot pacman -S ncurses automake autoconf gcc make
 # Compile the application
cd htop
../arch.fim fim-exec './autogen.sh'
../arch.fim fim-exec './configure'
../arch.fim fim-exec 'make'
 # Run the compiled application
./htop
```

### Inside the container

```bash
 # Set the maximum filesystem size (use du -sh ./focal.fim to see actual size)
./arch.fim fim-resize 4G
 # Fetch the application
git clone https://github.com/htop-dev/htop.git
 # Enter the container as root
FIM_ROOT=1 ./arch.fim
 # Install the required build dependencies
 (fim@arch) â†’ fakechroot pacman -S ncurses automake autoconf gcc make
 # Compile
 (fim@arch) â†’ cd htop
 (fim@arch) â†’ ./autogen.sh
 (fim@arch) â†’ ./configure
 (fim@arch) â†’ make
 # Run
 (fim@arch) â†’ ./htop
```

In this case `arch.fim` is now a portable building environment for htop.

# Samples

[1.](https://gitlab.com/formigoni/flatimage/-/blob/master/samples/sample-steam.sh?ref_type=heads) Portable steam

[2.](https://gitlab.com/formigoni/wine/-/releases) Portable wine

# Usage Inside Docker

Currently to run a flatimage inside docker, the `--privileged` flag is required.
Assuming that the current directory contains the image `alpine.fim`:

```
docker run --privileged -it --rm -v "$(pwd):/workdir" ubuntu:focal /bin/bash
cd workdir
./alpine.fim
```

# Further Considerations

FlatImage offers on build simplicity, packaging applications should be as simple as
installing them natively on the host system. This is an effort for the end-user
to not depend on the application developer to provide the portable binary (or to
handle how to package the application, dependencies and create a runner script).
It also simplifies the quality of life of the package developer, simplifying
the packaging process of applications.

# Motivations

1. The idea of this application sprung with the challenge to package software
   and dynamic libraries, such as `wine`, when there are hard-coded paths. The
   best solution is invasive
   [https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit/wiki/Bundling-Windows-applications](https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit/wiki/Bundling-Windows-applications)
   , which patches the binaries of wine directly to use a custom path for the
   32-bit libraries (an implementation of this concept is available
   [here](https://github.com/ruanformigoni/wine)), not only that, it requires to
   patch the `32-bit` pre-loader `ld-linux.so` as well, however, sometimes it
   still fails to execute properly. This is an over exceeding complexity for the
   end-user, which should package applications with no effort; `FlatImage`
   changes the root filesystem the application runs in, to a minimal gnu
   subsystem, and with that, it solves the previous issues with dynamic
   libraries no workarounds required. No host libraries are used, which
   decreases issues of portable applications working on one machine and not in
   other.

1. The fragmentation of the linux package management is considerable in modern
   times, e.g., `apt`, `pip`, `npm`, and more. To mitigate this issue
   `FlatImage` can perform the installation through the preferred package
   manager, and turn the program into an executable file, that can run in any
   linux distribution. E.g.: The user of `FlatImage` can create a binary of
   `youtube-dl`, from the `pip` package manager, without having either pip or
   python installed on the host operating system.

1. Some applications are offered as pre-compiled compressed tar files
   (tarballs), which sometimes only work when installed on the root of the
   operating system. However, doing so could hinder the operating system
   integrity, to avoid this issue `FlatImage` can install tarballs into itself
   and turn them into a portable binary.
